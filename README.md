# Welcome to "Principles of Corporate Pynance"
This is a project which started as an excentric way of spending some free time solving the excercises of one of my favourite financial books: "Principles of Corporate Finance" from the Authors Franklin Allen, Richard A. Brealey y Stewart Myers.

The project aims to show the solutions to all problems from the book but solved in Python.
